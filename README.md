# My Obsidian Notes
This repository contains my personal Obsidian vault, serving as a centralized knowledge base for my studies, personal projects, and daily life management.

## About This Repository
This vault is a dynamic collection of notes, thoughts, and resources organized using Obsidian. 

It's my personal space for:

- Learning & Study: Detailed notes, summaries, and reflections on various subjects, programming languages (C++, C#), technical concepts, and more.

- Personal Management: Tracking daily schedules, project plans, personal goals, ideas, and general life organization.

- Knowledge Management: Connecting ideas and building a personal graph of interconnected knowledge.
